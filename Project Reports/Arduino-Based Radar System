**Arduino-Based DIY Radar System**
A prototype radar system developed using Arduino, designed to detect object distance and movement through integrated sensors. The system processes sensor data in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback of object position and motion. The design was tested to simulate practical applications in monitoring, automation, and environmental sensing.
