**Flying Drone Simulation with Thermal Vision (Unreal Engine 5)**

A fully controllable drone simulation developed in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints. The project features realistic flight mechanics, allowing the drone to navigate freely within a 3D environment. Integrated thermal vision provides a simulated inspection tool, enabling visualization of heat signatures for equipment monitoring.

The simulation includes a motor fault scenario, where specific motors appear overheated while others remain cool, demonstrating how anomalies can be detected using visual thermal feedback. This is achieved through a combination of Custom Depth, Custom Stencil, and post-process materials, providing a clear, real-time representation of operational status.
