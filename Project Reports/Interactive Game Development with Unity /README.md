**2D Game Development in Unity (Flappy-bird style)**

A 2D arcade game built in Unity that demonstrates core project structure and basic game systems for quick prototyping. The player controls a single entity with a simple vertical “flap” input to navigate through a repeating obstacle course. Obstacles spawn periodically and move across the screen; scoring increments when the player passes through obstacle gaps, and collisions trigger a game-over state.

**Implementation highlights**

Player vertical movement controlled by input and simple physics/transform logic.
Procedural obstacle spawning with reusable prefabs to produce continuous challenge.
Score tracking based on successful passage through gaps; collision detection causes immediate game over.

**Skills & concepts demonstrated**

Unity 2D fundamentals: scene setup, sprites, prefabs, and simple UI.

Basic C# scripting for input handling, spawn logic, collision/score management.
