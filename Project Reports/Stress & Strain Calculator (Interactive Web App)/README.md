This is an interactive Stress & Strain Calculator built with Python and Streamlit, designed to help users calculate and visualize the mechanical behavior of materials under load. The app provides:

Stress: Force applied per unit area (Pa)

Strain: Relative deformation of the material

Young’s Modulus: Measure of material stiffness (Pa)

Stress-Strain Visualization: Graph showing the relationship between stress and strain

Users can select common engineering materials (Steel, Aluminum, Rubber), input force, cross-sectional area, original length, and deformation, and instantly see the calculated results along with a live stress-strain curve.

**Mechanical Engineering Relevance**


i. Material Behavior Analysis: Engineers need to know how materials deform under load to design safe and reliable structures.

ii. Design Verification: Helps check if a beam, rod, or component can safely withstand applied forces.

iii. Quick Prototyping & Simulation: Provides fast calculations during early-stage design or when physical testing is not possible.
